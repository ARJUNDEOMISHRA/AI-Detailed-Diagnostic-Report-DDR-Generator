**Detailed Diagnostic Report (DDR)**

**1. Property Issue Summary**
Evidence of moisture ingress and associated cosmetic damage (damp patches, peeling paint, water stains) was observed on a bedroom wall. Thermal imaging confirmed localized lower temperatures in the affected area, consistent with moisture presence.

**2. Area-wise Observations**
*   **Bedroom Wall:** Damp patches observed.
*   **Near Window:** Paint peeling.
*   **Wall (general):** Water stains present.
*   **Bedroom Wall (Thermal Scan):** Lower temperature detected, indicative of moisture.

**3. Probable Root Cause**
Moisture is likely present within the affected area of the bedroom wall, contributing to the observed lower temperatures, dampness, and cosmetic damage.
